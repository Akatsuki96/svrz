# ssvr
Structured Stochastic Variance Reduced methods


# Setup
Before executing the scripts, you have to install some packages. We suggest to create a new conda environment
```
conda create -n svrz python=3.9 numpy=1.25 matplotlib=3.7
```
Alternatively, you can install dependences using the `requirements.txt` file
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
or with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
